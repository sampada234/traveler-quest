Traveler's Quest is an iOS mobile app designed for the exploration of a user's surroundings. To do so, different locations and landmarks were marked as part of a category, such as all dining commons within the Amherst, MA area, and a user can see all of the unique locations that they can visit. Once visited, the location would be marked as visited and worked towards completion of its respective category. A reward system was thought of, in the form of highest number of locations and/or categories completed, however has not been implemented yet.

This project originated as the combination of two long standing ideas; a virtual sticker collection for the purpose of real life discounts as well as trading stickers between users, combined with the idea of exploring landmarks and taking photos as a virtual diary of places visited around the world. Along the way, many people from all backgrounds were talked to and consulted, with the purpose of fine-tuning and seeking advice. In the end, four people remained and are the members and developers: Ryan N, Chris G, William C, and Sampada T. 

Coding was done using Swift, Apple's programming language for mobile apps. Many challenges were faced, ranging from inability to code, to past members not being able to continue working on the project. Many members of the team did not know Swift starting this project, and used this time as a learning experience, putting an idea into a tangible product. Although we did not achieve everything what we wanted to at the end of the hackathon, we did gain coding knowledge in Swift, grew closer as a team, and are proud to have given this project our collective best efforts. 

Lastly, the developers would like to thank all contributions from people ranging from advice, to planning, to coding help. This product was done for HackUMass 2024, 11/8/24 to 11/10/24. 

Ryan: I am very happy that I could meet new people and create a product in a new language. Thank you everyone! 
William: I enjoyed working on this team and designing this app. It was a fun and engaging learning experience. Thank you everyone!
Sampada: I enjoyed being a part of this team and learning a new skill that I got to use to implement this really cool app. Thank you guys!
Chris: It was my first hackan and it was a really good time with this team
